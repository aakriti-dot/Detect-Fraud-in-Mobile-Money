# Detect-Fraud-in-Mobile-Money

In the year 2020, $4 billion was lost across the world due to fraud in mobile money. Due to these substantial losses, it is critical to look into the situation in order to prevent fraud in the future. This project aims to provide more insight into fraud and find which machine learning algorithm works best in order to detect and prevent such frauds in the future. Five algorithms will be used in this project including Logistic Regression, K-nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayesian, XGBoost, and Random Forests.

PaySim simulates mobile money transactions based on a sample of real transactions extracted from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service implemented in an African country. The original logs were provided by a multinational company, who is the provider of the mobile financial service which is currently running in more than 14 countries all around the world.
